# Startup Framework
Startup Framework built on some component and UI framework to allow you to build your project easily.

We integrate some useful component together to build a brand new framework.

In this framework we used these components:
- doctrine/dbal: for Database Abstraction
- symfony/http-foundation: for Request and Response Class
- monolog/monolog: for Log
- league/container: for Service container 
- twig/twig: for Template engine
- phroute/phroute: for Routing

UI & Theme:
- AdminLTE: for admin panel theme

Our mission is to make lite framework.
